# Video_Games_Sales_Prediction

This project is basically about PS4 and Xbox video game sales prediction by using machine learning. I'm using linear regression model to predict the sales. There are North America sales, Japan sales, Europe sales and others. By these features we predict the global sales. For this project, regression method is more suitable because the sales is continous values. To test the accuracy of the model I'm using R2 method, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The dataset taken from Kaggle.com
